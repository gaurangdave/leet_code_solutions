    "# Problem #1: Generating a Normalized Coordinate Grid\n",

    "\n",
    "**Context**\n",
    "In many computer vision tasks, particularly in object detection (e.g., YOLO, SSD), we divide an image into a grid. Each cell in this grid is responsible for predicting objects located within it. To do this, the model needs to know the location of each grid cell. Your task is to generate a tensor that contains the normalized (x, y) coordinates of the center of each cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Task**\n",
    "Write a Python function generate_normalized_grid(grid_size) that takes an integer grid_size and returns a TensorFlow tensor with the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shape**: (grid_size, grid_size, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Type**: tf.float32\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content**: The tensor should represent a grid where the last dimension [..., 0] holds the normalized x-coordinates and [..., 1] holds the normalized y-coordinates. The coordinates must be normalized to the range [0.0, 1.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normalization Logic**: For a grid of size N, the center of the cell at (row, col) has coordinates ((col + 0.5) / N, (row + 0.5) / N).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "If grid_size = 2, the expected output tensor is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "<tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 2, 2), dtype=float32, numpy=\n",
    "[[[0.25, 0.25],  # Cell at (row=0, col=0) -> (x=0.25, y=0.25)\n",
